# Company Bankruptcy Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy based on its financial metrics. Early detection of bankruptcy can help mitigate losses for stakeholders and aid in decision-making for investors and analysts.

---

## Problem Statement
Bankruptcy prediction is critical in financial risk management. The objective is to develop a binary classification model that can accurately identify companies that are likely to go bankrupt based on historical financial data.

The dataset consists of financial indicators such as:
- Financial ratios (debt, equity, liquidity)
- Profitability metrics
- Cash flow and operational metrics

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Feature scaling and transformation
   - Label encoding (if needed)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Distribution of features
   - Class imbalance visualization

3. **Model Building**
   - Train/Test split
   - Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
   - Resampling techniques (SMOTE or similar) for imbalance

4. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve

5. **Conclusion**
   - Model comparison
   - Feature importance analysis
